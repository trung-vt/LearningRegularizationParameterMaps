# Task

**Try to keep a note of everything! Don't delete anything unless absolutely wrong or redundant.**

Train

- Try to reproduce the results for simple cases first

    - The square image in the slides (ask Kostas?)

    - The turtle image in the slides (ask Kostas?)

- Only one patch to see the best result

- Properly train and validate with multiple patches and images

  - K-Fold cross-validation

Record data

- SSIM

- Box plots

- Line plots of single lambda values

- Multiple $T_{\text{train}}$ values (8, 16, ..., 256) against multiple $T_{\text{test}}$ values (8, 16, ..., 4096)
